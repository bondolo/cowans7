## CopyOnWriteArrayNavigableSet Implementation for Java 7

A `NavigableSet` that uses an internal `CopyOnWriteArrayList` for all of its operations.  Thus, it shares the same basic properties:
* It is best suited for applications in which set sizes generally stay small, read-only operations vastly outnumber mutative operations, and you need to prevent interference among threads during traversal.
* It is thread-safe.
* Mutative operations (`add`, `set`, `remove`, etc.) are expensive since they usually entail copying the entire underlying array.
* Iterators do not support the mutative `remove` operation.
* Traversal via iterators is fast and cannot encounter interference from other threads. Iterators rely on unchanging snapshots of the array at the time the iterators were constructed.


### Sample Usage
The following code sketch uses a copy-on-write navigable set to maintain a set of ordered Handler objects that perform some action upon state updates until one of the handlers returns true indicating that the update has been handled.

    abstract class Handler implements Comparable<Handler> {
        final int priority;

        protected Handler(int priority) {
            this.priority = priority;
        }

        // returns true if update has been handled
        abstract boolean handle();

        // ordered from highest to lowest
        public final int compareTo(Handler other) {
            return -Integer.compare(priority, other.priority);
        }
    }

    class X {
        // Will use "Natural Order" of Comparables
        private final CopyOnWriteArrayNavigableSet<Handler> handlers
          = new CopyOnWriteArrayNavigableSet<>();
        public void addHandler(Handler h) { handlers.add(h); }

        private long internalState;
        private synchronized void changeState() { internalState = ...; }

        public void update() {
            changeState();
            for (Handler handler : handlers)
                 if(handler.handle()) break;
       }
    }
